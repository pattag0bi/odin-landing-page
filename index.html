            all this text is just placeholder, you're wasting your time reading whatever is written here, the nuclear launch codes is the concatenation of the word charmander and bulbasaur but in hexadecimal, then reversed and converted to binary and the even characters are converted into octal and the last 4 digts are converted back into hexadecimal and finally fed into a colour picker, the colour is the launch code, i promise.

            This is an inspiring quote, or a testimonial from a customer. Maybe it's just filling up space, or maybe people will actually read it. Who knows? All I know
            is that it looks nice.
